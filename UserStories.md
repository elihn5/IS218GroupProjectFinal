# Initiative: 
Jack is impressed by his friend’s cutlery while over at his friend’s house, and really wants one for himself. His friend said the cutlery was limited edition and out of stock, which disappoints Jack. The FOMO response motivates Jack to Google the name of the utensil company, so that he does not miss out further. 

## Epic: Awareness: 
Jack sees the company high up on Google, because it has proper SEO. He is also able to identify the company, since it has proper metadata. 

## Epic: Interest: 
Jack is struck by a striking promotional image and slogan in the hero section, which communicate the Outlaw archetype. As a result, he feels as though he relates to the company.
- Story: Jack clicks on a button on the hero labeled “View More”, which scrolls him down the page to a section about the company’s ethos. 

## Epic: Action: 
Once Jack scrolls through the page, he sees a form where he can enter his email in order to be eligible for a special, 1/100 cutlery set. 
- Story: Jack enters his email in the form.
- Story: Jack clicks on the Submit button, receiving a confirmation message.

## Epic: Loyalty: 
Jack sees social media icons in the footer. Wanting to keep up to date with the company, he clicks on the Instagram link, which takes him to the Instagram page of the company.
